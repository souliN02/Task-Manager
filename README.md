# Task-Manager Web Application
 
This project is made as a part of an internship trial, that will demonstrate my web development skills. The goal is to create a simple web application for managing tasks, where a user should be able to create an account, log in, create, read, update and delete tasks. Here you can read the more specific requirements given by the company:

## 1. User Authentication
* Users should be able to register with their email and password.
* Users should be able to log in and log out.

## 2. Task Management:
* Users should be able to create a new task with a title and description.
* Users should be able to view a list of all their tasks.
* Users should be able to update the title and description of their tasks.
* Users should be able to delete a task

## 3.Database:
* Use a relational database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store user and task information.
* Each user should have their own set of tasks.
